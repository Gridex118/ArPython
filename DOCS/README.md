# ArPython
A minimal bytecode type implementation of Python written in C

### This is just a hobby project; a not so seriously implemented approximation of the common CPython implementation.

## Minimum Features
- The basic primitives (lists, touples, numbers and strings)  
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Arithmatic and logical operators
- Functions  
- File importing  

## Nice to haves
- Classes
- Ternary operator
- Generators
